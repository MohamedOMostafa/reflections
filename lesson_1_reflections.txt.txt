-It helped me find my typos easily and get a fast overview of the changes I made to the file.

-With bigger blocks of codes or bigger programmes it's better to have history versions of your
programme for revision and debugging.

-Pros:
1-Your save points would be meaningful because you know when you have added features or fixed
bugs.
2-You work at your own pace and the pattern that suits you the most.

-Cons:
1-You're subject to human error when you forget to save.
2-If the power goes off you might have a more recent save point with the auto saving.

-Because when it comes to code files they're usually related, so changes in one file in most
cases affect changes in the other files, while in the other cases changes in one files doesn't
necessarily affect the other files.

-By using git log command you get to see all the commits of your file and by using git
diff you get to see what changes were made in that commit in comparison to the one 
before.

-Because you can always go back to a commit where your programme was working fine
and figure our what went wrong and at what point.
